Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 *.cpp~ *.txt~ 
g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=c++03 -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.cpp cyoa.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 test-story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
This page does not exist, cannot add choice pages!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 *.cpp~ *.txt~ 
g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=c++03 -o cyoa-step2 cyoa-step2.cpp cyoa.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------


2.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 test-story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Error! Page12000is not a valid choice page
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


2.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 test-story3 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
There exist page(s) which are not references by other pages
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


2.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 test-story4 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
There must be at least 1 win page!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


2.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story1  <  story1_input1.txt
