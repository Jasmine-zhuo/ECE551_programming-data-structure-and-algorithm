Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm cyoa-step1 *.cpp~ *.txt~ 
g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=c++03 -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
An error occured when opening a page file!
But we did not.
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm cyoa-step1 *.cpp~ *.txt~ 
The code did not compile!

Overall Grade: NO GRADE YET
